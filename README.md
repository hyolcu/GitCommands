# Hello, welcome to my github page!

I aim to achieve with this repository to learn git actions.

- " git add -A ." this command takes files to staging area.
- " git commit -m" this command commits the changes in staging area.
- "git checkout -b new-branch" this command creates new branch and switch to it.
- "git pull" this command takes changes from the remote.
